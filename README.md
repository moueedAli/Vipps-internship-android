# Vipps Summer Internship - Technical case - Android

This is a technical internship task from Vipps. The task is to retrieve information from Restful countries API and show it in an Android app.

## The task

The task is structured in two different parts. First part is to fetch the API by generating an auth token and retrieve information about:

- The country name
- The country capital
- The name of the current president

## Part 1:

Refer to the documentation to generate an auth token and query by country, where you replace `{country}` with the name of a country of your choice.

## Part 2:

Display a search field and a button so the user can search for any country and show the information from part 1.

The UI does not need to be advanced, just a simple input field and a button.

### Example:

Here’s an example of how it should work:

1. User enters "Norway" in the search field.
2. The app fetches and displays:
   - **Country**: Norway
   - **Capital**: Oslo
   - **President**: Not applicable (replace with "Prime Minister: Jonas Gahr Støre").
